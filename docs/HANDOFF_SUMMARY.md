## 🎯 How to Use

### Managing Subscription Tiers

1. **Access the page**:
   ```
   https://your-domain.com/admin/system/subscription-management
   ```

   - Set features (checkboxes)
   - Save

3. **Migrate users**:
   - Select users from table
   - Click "Migrate Users"
   - Choose target tier
   - Provide reason (required)
   - Confirm

4. **View analytics**:
   - Top cards show: total tiers, active tiers, total users, revenue
   - Tier table shows: user count, feature count per tier

### Configuring Monitoring

1. **Grafana** (when deployed):
   - Go to: https://your-domain.com/admin/monitoring/grafana
   - Test connection
   - View dashboards
   - Manage data sources

2. **Prometheus** (when deployed):
   - Go to: https://your-domain.com/admin/monitoring/prometheus
   - Configure scrape targets (6 pre-defined)
   - Set retention policies
   - View metrics

3. **Umami** (when deployed):

## 📋 Next Steps

### Immediate (Optional)

1. **Deploy Atlas to Brigade**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://api.brigade.your-domain.com/api/agents \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
     -d @/home/muut/Production/UC-Cloud/services/ops-center/atlas/architecture/atlas-agent.json
   ```

2. **Deploy monitoring services** (if needed):
   - Grafana for dashboards
   - Prometheus for metrics
   - Umami for web analytics

### Short-term (1-2 days)

1. User acceptance testing
2. Monitor production for issues
3. Gather feedback from admins

### Long-term (Future Sprints)

1. Edge Device Management (Epic 7.1)
2. Advanced analytics dashboards
3. Email notification system
4. Custom domain support

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Subscription Management Issues

**Q**: Tier list not loading?
**A**: Check backend logs: `docker logs ops-center-direct --tail 50`

**Q**: Can't create tier?
**A**: Verify you have System Admin or Org Admin role

**Q**: User migration failed?
**A**: Check audit log table: `SELECT * FROM user_tier_history ORDER BY performed_at DESC LIMIT 10;`

### Monitoring Page Issues

**Q**: "Connection failed" errors?
**A**: This is expected if Grafana/Prometheus/Umami aren't deployed yet. Health checks will show "healthy" but data endpoints return errors.

**Q**: How do I deploy monitoring services?
**A**: Use docker-compose to add Grafana, Prometheus, Umami services (separate deployment)

### Atlas Issues

**Q**: Where is Atlas?
**A**: Code is complete at `/services/ops-center/atlas/` but needs Brigade deployment

**Q**: How do I deploy Atlas?
**A**: See Atlas deployment guide: `/services/ops-center/atlas/docs/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`
