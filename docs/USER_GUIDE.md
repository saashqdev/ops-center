## Introduction

Ops-Center is the **centralized management hub** for the UC-Cloud ecosystem. It provides a comprehensive administrative interface for managing users, billing, services, organizations, and LLM infrastructure.

### Think of it like:
- **Ops-Center** = AWS Console (infrastructure management)
- **Brigade** = GitHub (agent repository)
- **Open-WebUI** = VS Code (where you actually work)
- **Center-Deep** = Google Search (research tool)

### Key Features:
- User management (Keycloak SSO users)
- Billing & subscription management (Lago integration)
- Service monitoring and control (Docker containers)
- Hardware monitoring (GPU, CPU, memory, storage)
- LLM management (models, providers, usage tracking)
- Organization management (multi-tenancy)

---

## User Management vs Local Users

**This is the #1 source of confusion** - let's clarify the difference:

### User Management (Application Users)
**Location**: `/admin/system/users`

**What it shows**:
- Application users who log in via Keycloak SSO
- Users authenticated with Google, GitHub, Microsoft, or email/password
- Users with subscriptions, API keys, and organization memberships

**What you can do**:
- Invite new users
- Assign roles (admin, moderator, developer, analyst, viewer)
- Manage subscriptions and billing
- View user activity and sessions
- Issue API keys for programmatic access

**When to use**:
- Adding team members to your organization
- Controlling who can access the application
- Managing billing and subscriptions
- Reviewing user activity

### Local Users (Container System Users)
**Location**: `/admin/system/local-users` or `/admin/infrastructure/local-users`

**What it shows**:
- Linux system users inside the Docker container (ops-center-direct)
- Users like "nobody", "root", "www-data", "muut"
- System accounts used for process isolation and security

**What you can do**:
- Create Linux users for SSH access
- Grant sudo permissions
- Manage SSH keys for remote access
- Control system-level access

**When to use**:
- Setting up SSH access to the container
- Debugging infrastructure issues
- Managing system-level permissions
- Configuring service accounts

**Important**: These are **NOT** the same as application users. If you want to add a user who can log into the application, use **User Management**, not **Local Users**.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "401 Unauthorized" Errors

**Symptoms**: API calls fail with 401 status

**Solutions**:
- Log out and log back in to refresh your session
- Check if your session has expired (default: 24 hours)
- Verify you have the required role for the action
- Clear browser cache and cookies

#### 2. Services Won't Start

**Symptoms**: Service stuck in "Starting" state

**Solutions**:
- Check Docker logs for error messages
- Verify sufficient system resources (CPU, RAM, disk)
- Ensure required ports are not in use
- Restart Docker daemon if needed

#### 3. Metrics Showing 0

**Symptoms**: User metrics cards show 0 even though users exist

**Solutions**:
- Keycloak users may not have custom attributes populated
- Run attribute population script:
  ```bash
  docker exec ops-center-direct python3 /app/scripts/quick_populate_users.py
  ```
- Configure Keycloak User Profile (see admin guide)

#### 4. GPU Not Detected

**Symptoms**: Hardware page shows no GPU

**Solutions**:
- Verify GPU is physically installed
- Check NVIDIA/AMD drivers are installed
- Ensure Docker has GPU access:
  ```bash
  docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:12.0-base nvidia-smi
  ```
- Restart container with GPU passthrough

#### 5. Frontend Not Loading

**Symptoms**: White screen or React errors

**Solutions**:
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Hard reload: Ctrl + Shift + R
- Clear browser cache completely
- Verify frontend files exist in public/assets/
- Check container logs for errors

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: What is Ops-Center?**
A: Ops-Center is the centralized admin dashboard for UC-Cloud. It manages users, billing, services, and infrastructure.

**Q: Do I need to be a system admin to use Ops-Center?**
A: No. Different sections are available based on your role:
- **All users**: Account settings, subscription management
- **Org admins**: Organization management, team settings
- **Platform admins**: System administration, infrastructure management

**Q: Is my data secure?**
A: Yes. Ops-Center uses:
- Keycloak SSO with industry-standard authentication
- Encrypted API keys (bcrypt hashing)
- HTTPS/SSL for all connections
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Audit logging for compliance

### User Management

**Q: How do I add a new team member?**
A: Go to **User Management** (`/admin/system/users`) and click "Invite User". Enter their email and assign a role.

**Q: What's the difference between User Management and Local Users?**
A: **User Management** shows application users (Keycloak SSO). **Local Users** shows Linux system users inside the Docker container. See [User Management vs Local Users](#user-management-vs-local-users) for details.

**Q: Can I bulk import users?**
A: Yes. Go to User Management, click the bulk actions menu, and select "Import from CSV". Follow the template format.

**Q: How do I reset a user's password?**
A: Users must reset their own passwords via the Keycloak login page. Admins cannot see or reset passwords directly (by design for security).

### Billing & Subscriptions

**Q: What subscription tiers are available?**
A:
- **Trial**: $1/week (7 days)
- **Starter**: $19/month (1,000 API calls)
- **Professional**: $49/month (10,000 API calls) ⭐ Most Popular
- **Enterprise**: $99/month (Unlimited API calls)

**Q: How do I upgrade my plan?**
A: Go to **My Subscription → Current Plan** and click "Upgrade". Choose your new tier and complete payment.

**Q: What is BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)?**
A: BYOK allows you to use your own API keys for LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) instead of consuming platform credits. Available on Professional and Enterprise tiers.

**Q: How do credits work?**
A: Credits are usage quotas. Each API call consumes credits. When you run out, you either upgrade or purchase more credits. BYOK users aren't charged credits when using their own keys.

### Services & Infrastructure

**Q: Can I deploy my own services?**
A: Yes, but you'll need to modify Docker Compose files. This requires system admin access and Docker knowledge.

**Q: How do I access service logs?**
A: Go to **Services**, find your service, and click the "View Logs" button. Logs stream in real-time.

**Q: Why can't I start a service?**
A: Common reasons:
- Insufficient resources (RAM, CPU)
- Port conflict (port already in use)
- Missing dependencies
- Configuration error (check logs)

**Q: What is Traefik?**
A: Traefik is a reverse proxy that handles:
- SSL/TLS certificates (Let's Encrypt)
- Routing traffic to services
- Load balancing
- Automatic service discovery

### LLM & AI

**Q: What LLM models are available?**
A: 100+ models via OpenRouter, including:
- OpenAI: GPT-4, GPT-3.5
- Anthropic: Claude 3 (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)
- Google: Gemini Pro
- Meta: Llama 2, Llama 3
- Mistral: Mistral 7B, Mixtral 8x7B

**Q: How do I add a custom model?**
A: Go to **LLM Management** → **LLM Providers** and configure your provider. Add your API key and select models.

**Q: What is the LLM Hub?**
A: LLM Hub is the centralized interface for managing:
- Model catalog (browse available models)
- Provider configuration (API keys, endpoints)
- Usage tracking (costs, token counts)
- Routing logic (fallbacks, load balancing)

**Q: Can I use my own GPU for inference?**
A: Yes, but this requires custom setup. You'll need to:
1. Configure vLLM with your GPU
2. Update Docker Compose GPU passthrough
3. Ensure CUDA drivers are compatible

### Organizations

**Q: What is an organization?**
A: Organizations allow multi-tenancy:
- Multiple users under one account
- Shared resources and billing
- Centralized administration
- Team collaboration

**Q: How do I create an organization?**
A: Platform admins can create organizations via **Organizations** → **Create Organization**.

**Q: Can a user belong to multiple organizations?**
A: Yes. Users can be members of multiple organizations with different roles in each.

**Q: Who can manage an organization?**
A:
- **Owner**: Full control (billing, team, settings)
- **Admin**: Team and settings (no billing)
- **Member**: Access organization resources

### Troubleshooting

**Q: Why am I seeing "Failed to load data" errors?**
A: This usually means:
1. Backend is down (check Services page)
2. Session expired (log out and log back in)
3. Network issue (check browser console)
4. API endpoint error (check container logs)

**Q: How do I report a bug?**
A: Create an issue on GitHub: https://github.com/Unicorn-Commander/UC-Cloud/issues

**Q: Where can I find logs?**
A:
- **Application logs**: Services page → View Logs button
