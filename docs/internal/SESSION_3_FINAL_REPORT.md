**Features**:
- List all organizations (admin-only)
- Pagination support (limit, offset)
- Filter by status (active, suspended, deleted)
- Filter by subscription tier
- Search by organization name
- Returns enriched data with member counts, owner info, tier, status

**Response Format**:
```json
{
  "organizations": [
    {
      "id": "org_12345",
      "name": "Acme Corp",
      "owner": "owner@example.com",
      "member_count": 5,
      "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "subscription_tier": "professional",
      "status": "active"
    }
  ],
  "total": 100
}
```

#### Frontend Page (625 lines)
**File**: `src/pages/organization/OrganizationsList.jsx`

**Features Implemented**:

1. **Metrics Cards** (4 cards):
   - Total Organizations
   - Active Organizations

   - Professional Tier Count

2. **Search & Filters**:
   - Search by name (debounced 500ms)
   - Filter by status (All, Active, Suspended, Deleted)
   - Filter by tier (All, Trial, Starter, Professional, Enterprise)
   - Refresh button

3. **Organizations Table**:
   - **Columns**: Name, Owner, Members, Tier, Status, Created, Actions
   - **Clickable rows** → Navigate to organization detail page
   - **Color-coded badges**:
     - Status: Active (green), Suspended (yellow), Deleted (red)
     - Tier: Enterprise (red), Professional (purple), Starter (blue), Trial (yellow)
   - **Pagination**: 5, 10, 25, 50 rows per page
   - **Responsive design**: Mobile-friendly layout

4. **Actions**:
   - **Create Organization**: Opens CreateOrganizationModal
   - **View Details**: Navigate to `/admin/organization/team?org={id}`
   - **Suspend/Activate**: Toggle organization status
   - **Delete**: Confirmation modal with warning

5. **User Experience**:
   - Toast notifications for success/error
   - Loading states during API calls
   - Error handling with user-friendly messages
   - Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
   - Empty states when no data

#### Routing Updates
**File**: `src/App.jsx` (+10 lines)

**Routes Added**:
- `/admin/organizations` → OrganizationsList
- `/admin/organization/team` → OrganizationTeam
- `/admin/organization/roles` → OrganizationRoles
- `/admin/organization/settings` → OrganizationSettings
- `/admin/organization/billing` → OrganizationBilling

**Legacy Routes Maintained**:
- `/admin/org/*` routes still work (backwards compatibility)

---

## 🏗️ INTEGRATION & PATTERNS

### Reused Components
1. **CreateOrganizationModal** - Existing modal for creating orgs
2. **OrganizationContext** - For switching active organization
3. **Toast** - For user notifications
4. **Material-UI** - Consistent component library

### UI/UX Patterns Followed
**Based on**: UserManagement.jsx (proven pattern)

**Layout**:
- Metrics cards at top (statistics overview)
- Search + filters toolbar (user controls)
- Data table with pagination (main content)
- Action buttons in rightmost column

**Visual Design**:
- Color-coded status badges (consistent with UserManagement)
- Icon buttons for actions
- Hover effects on clickable rows
- Material-UI Paper components for elevation

**Interactions**:
- Toast notifications for feedback
- Confirmation modals for destructive actions
- Loading states during async operations
- Debounced search (performance optimization)
