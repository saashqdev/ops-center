## 🏗️ Hierarchical Agent Deployment Strategy

### PM Role (Claude - You)

As **Project Manager**, you:
- Define epic scope and success criteria
- Deploy **Team Leads** as top-level agents
- Coordinate between team leads
- Make architectural decisions
- Review deliverables
- Report progress to user
- Handle blockers and resource allocation

### Team Lead Role

Each **Team Lead** agent can:
- Break down epic into tasks
- **Spawn specialized subagents** as needed
- Coordinate subagent work
- Integrate subagent deliverables
- Report to PM (you)
- Make tactical decisions within their domain

### Subagent Role

Each **Subagent** (spawned by team lead):
- Execute specific task
- Report to their team lead
- Deliver code, tests, or documentation
- Cannot spawn additional agents

### Example Hierarchical Structure

## 🎓 Best Practices for Hierarchical Agents

### DO's ✅

1. **Deploy Team Leads in Parallel**
   ```javascript
   // Single message with multiple Task calls
   Task("Integration Lead", "...", "backend-dev")
   Task("Security Lead", "...", "reviewer")
   Task("Testing Lead", "...", "tester")
   ```

2. **Give Team Leads Autonomy**
   - Let them decide which subagents to spawn
   - Trust their domain expertise
   - Don't micromanage their approach

3. **Clear Success Criteria**
   - Define what "done" looks like
   - Provide acceptance criteria
   - Set quality standards

4. **Batch Operations**
   - Use TodoWrite for all todos at once
   - Spawn all team leads together
   - Commit all changes together

5. **Documentation First**
   - Each epic starts with requirements doc
   - Each epic ends with deployment summary
   - Track decisions in markdown files

### DON'Ts ❌

1. **Don't Deploy Sequentially**
   - Bad: Deploy team lead 1, wait, deploy team lead 2
   - Good: Deploy all team leads in parallel

2. **Don't Over-Specify**
   - Bad: Tell team lead exactly how to implement
   - Good: Define requirements, let them choose approach

3. **Don't Forget Integration**
   - Bad: Team leads work in isolation
   - Good: PM integrates deliverables across teams

4. **Don't Skip Testing**
   - Bad: Deploy without testing
   - Good: Quick smoke tests before deployment

5. **Don't Create Files at Root**
   - Bad: Save files to /home/muut/Production/UC-Cloud/test.md
   - Good: Save to appropriate subdirectory (docs/, scripts/, backend/)

---

## 📈 Success Metrics

### Development Velocity
- **Epic 1.8**: 12,000 lines in 3 hours (4,000 lines/hour with agents)
- **Target**: Maintain 2,000-3,000 lines/hour for Phase 2 epics
- **Parallel Efficiency**: 3x faster than sequential

### Code Quality
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain ≥ 80% for all new code
- **Documentation**: Every epic has 3+ docs (requirements, delivery, API)
- **Code Review**: PM reviews all integrations

### Business Impact
- **Revenue**: Enable self-service upgrades by end of Week 2
- **User Experience**: Mobile-friendly by end of Week 3
- **Operations**: Automated emails reduce support tickets
