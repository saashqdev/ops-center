CONTEXT: I'm working on the UC-Cloud Ops Center multi-tenant SaaS platform. In the previous session, we successfully completed SSO integration with Keycloak uchub realm and fixed the payment flow. Both Google/GitHub/Microsoft SSO and Stripe payment checkout are now fully operational.

CURRENT STATE:
- SSO working: Keycloak uchub realm with 3 identity providers (Google/GitHub/Microsoft)
- Payment working: Stripe checkout integration via Lago billing
- Backups created: /home/muut/backups/ops-center-backup-20251013-215242.tar.gz
- Documentation updated: CLAUDE.md, SSO-SETUP-COMPLETE.md, NEXT-SESSION-HANDOFF.md
- All systems operational and tested

YOUR TASK:
I need you to refine the Ops-Center dashboard menus, section by section. The application needs a logical, user-friendly navigation structure that matches our multi-tenant SaaS architecture.

APPROACH:
1. First, audit the current menu structure in /services/ops-center/src/
2. Review existing pages, routes, and navigation components
3. Then work through each section systematically:
   - Dashboard/Home
   - Billing/Subscription Management
   - Settings (including BYOK API keys)
   - User Management (organization users)
   - Admin Panel (system administration)

4. For each section:
   - Review current implementation
   - Propose improvements
   - Implement changes (routes, components, styling)
   - Test navigation and role-based access
   - Document changes

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
- Multi-tenant: Each user belongs to an organization
- Roles: owner (full access), admin (manage users/billing), member (limited)
- Frontend: React 18+ with React Router and Tailwind CSS
- Backend: FastAPI with Keycloak for auth
- All authentication uses Keycloak uchub realm (not Authentik)

REFERENCE FILES:
- Full handoff doc: /services/ops-center/NEXT-SESSION-HANDOFF.md
- SSO config: /services/ops-center/SSO-SETUP-COMPLETE.md
- Project config: /home/muut/CLAUDE.md

VERIFICATION BEFORE STARTING:
Run this to ensure everything still works:
```bash
cd /home/muut/Production/UC-Cloud/services/ops-center/backend/tests
python3 verify_uchub_sso.py
```

Please start by auditing the current menu structure, then propose a refinement plan before implementing changes. Work section by section, and test as you go.
