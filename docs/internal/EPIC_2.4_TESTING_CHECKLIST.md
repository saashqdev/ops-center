## 🐛 Known Issues to Monitor

Based on Testing & UX Lead's analysis:

1. **Proration Edge Case** (P2): Calculation may be off by $0.01 for mid-month upgrades due to float rounding
   - **Workaround**: Use `Decimal` type for currency
   - **Fix**: Update `lago_integration.py` line 145

2. **Payment Failure Retry** (P1): Retry button doesn't re-initialize Stripe checkout
   - **Impact**: Users must refresh page to retry
   - **Fix**: Call `create_checkout_session()` again on retry

3. **Keycloak Attribute Delay** (P2): User attribute updates may take 1-2 seconds to sync
   - **Impact**: UI may show old tier for brief moment
   - **Workaround**: Poll for update or show loading state
