## Key Integration Points

### 1. Authentication Flow

```
User → Keycloak Login → Session Token Cookie
     → Ops-Center API (validates session)
     → Extracts user_id + org_id
     → Service can now make billing API calls
```

### 2. Credit Deduction Flow

```
1. Check credits (optional, for UX)
   ↓
2. Perform operation
   ↓
3. IF operation succeeds:
   → Deduct credits
   → Record attribution
   ELSE:
   → Do NOT deduct credits
```

### 3. Multi-Organization Support

```
User belongs to: [Org A, Org B, Org C]
                      ↓
Application: "Which organization?"
                      ↓
User selects: Org B
                      ↓
All operations use: org_id = Org B
```

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Get Session Token

```python
session_token = request.cookies.get('session_token')
```

### 2. Get User's Organizations

```python
response = requests.get(
    'https://api.your-domain.com/api/v1/org-billing/billing/user',
    cookies={'session_token': session_token}
)
orgs = response.json()['organizations']
org_id = orgs[0]['org_id']  # Or let user select
```

### 3. Check Credits (Optional)

```python
has_credits = await conn.fetchval(
    "SELECT has_sufficient_credits($1, $2, $3)",
    org_id, user_id, 50
)
```

### 4. Perform Operation

```python
result = await enrich_company(company_id)
```

### 5. Deduct Credits (After Success)

```python
await conn.execute(
    "SELECT deduct_credits($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7::jsonb)",
    org_id, user_id, 50, 'company_enrichment',
    'LoopNet Company Enrichment v2',
    request_id, json.dumps(metadata)
)
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T: Deduct credits before operation

```python
# WRONG - credits deducted even if operation fails
await deduct_credits(50)
result = await enrich_company()  # Might fail
```

### ✅ DO: Deduct credits after operation succeeds

```python
# CORRECT - only deduct if operation succeeds
result = await enrich_company()
if result.success:
    await deduct_credits(50)
```

### ❌ DON'T: Use hardcoded org_id

```python
# WRONG - assumes user only has one org
org_id = "some-uuid"
```

### ✅ DO: Get org_id from user session

```python
# CORRECT - respects user's org selection
user_context = await get_user_org_context(session_token)
org_id = user_context['org_id']
```

### ❌ DON'T: Ignore insufficient credit errors

```python
# WRONG - operation proceeds even without credits
try:
    await deduct_credits(50)
except:
    pass  # Ignores error
await perform_operation()  # Runs without payment
```

### ✅ DO: Block operation if insufficient credits

```python
# CORRECT - check credits first, block if insufficient
has_credits = await check_sufficient_credits(org_id, user_id, 50)
if not has_credits:
    raise HTTPException(402, "Insufficient credits")
# Only perform operation if user has credits
await perform_operation()
await deduct_credits(50)
```

## Testing Resources

### Test Organization Request

Contact Ops-Center team to create test org:

```json
{
  "org_name": "test-loopnet-integration",
  "display_name": "LoopNet Test Organization",
  "subscription_plan": "platform",
  "initial_credits": 10000,
  "test_users": [
    {"email": "loopnet-test-1@example.com", "allocated_credits": 1000},
    {"email": "loopnet-test-2@example.com", "allocated_credits": 500}
  ]
}
```

### Database Queries for Testing

```bash
# View user allocations
docker exec unicorn-postgresql psql -U unicorn -d unicorn_db -c "
  SELECT user_id, allocated_credits, used_credits, remaining_credits
  FROM user_credit_allocations
  WHERE org_id = 'TEST_ORG_UUID';"

# View recent credit usage
docker exec unicorn-postgresql psql -U unicorn -d unicorn_db -c "
  SELECT service_type, credits_used, request_metadata->>'company_id',
         created_at
  FROM credit_usage_attribution
  WHERE org_id = 'TEST_ORG_UUID'
  ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;"
```
