  - Billing Admin: View/manage billing only
  - Member: Use organization resources only

- ✅ **Organization Context** - Multi-org support

  - `PUT /api/v1/org/{org_id}/members/{user_id}/role` - Change role
  - `DELETE /api/v1/org/{org_id}/members/{user_id}` - Remove member
  - `GET /api/v1/org/{org_id}/stats` - Organization statistics
  - Organization CRUD endpoints (create, read, update, delete)

**Database Integration**:
