   # Expected: "status": "healthy"
   ```

2. **Manual UI Testing** ⏳
   - Login to `https://your-domain.com/admin`
   - Navigate to `/admin/infrastructure/migration`
   - Verify wizard loads
   - Test Step 1: Domain discovery
   - Test Step 2: DNS export

3. **Rotate API Credentials** ⚠️ CRITICAL (Before Production Use)
   - Go to: `https://ap.www.namecheap.com/settings/tools/apiaccess/`
   - Generate new API key
   - Update `.env.auth` with new key
   - Restart container
   - Verify health status

### Optional Enhancements

## Known Issues

### 1. Audit Logging Initialization Failed

**Error**: `'AuditLogger' object has no attribute 'initialize'`
**Impact**: Low (non-blocking)
**Status**: Known issue, does not affect migration functionality
**Resolution**: Deferred to separate maintenance task

### 2. Health Check Shows "Degraded"

**Status**: "degraded" (expected before credential loading)
**Cause**: Container hasn't read `.env.auth` yet
**Resolution**: Restart container to reload credentials
**Expected After Restart**: "status": "healthy"

### 3. Large Frontend Bundle

**Warning**: UserManagement component is 875.23 kB
**Impact**: Moderate (slower initial page load)
**Status**: Known technical debt
**Mitigation**: Consider code splitting in future iterations
